## Presentation Mode

*Available to business subscribers only*

Presentation Mode allows your topic page to be viewed in a real-time, cascading display that is perfect for social media walls, office displays, events, etc. Results will be displayed in a grid-style view with full image visibility and new results automatically updated. In addition, the navigation bar, banner and toolbar will all be removed in order to focus on the content being displayed. 

To activate the Presentation Mode plugin *click* the **Presentation Mode** plugin in the available plugins window.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/plugins/presentation_mode_plugin_0.png"></div>

This will provide a short description of the plugin, the ability to remove the plugin and the option to require result approvals before they are displayed on the topic (this option will require an administrator to manually approve posts before they appear on the screen, giving you a level of control over what is displayed on the screen).

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/plugins/presentation_mode_plugin_1.png"></div>

Once this plugin is activated on a topic, you can enter presentation mode by *navigating* to the topic and *clicking* the **expand** button in the toolbar. 

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/plugins/presentation_mode_plugin_2.png"></div>

You can exit presentation mode by *clicking* the **collapse** button in the upper-right of the screen. *Hovering* over the upper-right corner of the screen will increase the visibility of this button.

You can activate the Widget plugin by *clicking* on the **Widget** plugin in the availabe plugins window.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/plugins/widget_plugin_0.png"></div>

## Directory

The Directory plugin allows you to create a directory of links and contacts to appear either as the first result card on your topic page or as the banner of your topic. This directory can contain links that are important to your business or contacts that are imperative for your customers or team members. 

You can add this plugin by *clicking* the **Directory** plugin located in the Available Plugins window. 

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/plugins/directory_plugin_0.png"></div>

This will bring you to the Directory plugin manager, where you can add and remove links and style the directory however you see fit. 

The **Links** tab allows you to add and remove any links that appear in your directory. It's very simple, just give your link a display name and either a URL or a phone number.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/plugins/directory_plugin_1.png"></div>

The **Theme** tab allows you to customize the appearance of your directory. You can give it a name, choose whether it appears as a result card or in the top banner, choose the link color and font-family, and choose the background (whether it's a color or a background image, which you can upload).
