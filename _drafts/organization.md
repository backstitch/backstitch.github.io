Organizations allow team members to share topics among themselves, keeping everyone up to date with the most current information. For more information click [here](http://backstit.ch/business).

### Organization Dashboard 

You can access your organization dashboard by *clicking* the **settings gear** in the upper right corner and then *clicking* the name of your organization. 

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/organizations/settings_organization.png"></div>

The organization dashboard allows you to manage your organization, view analytics, submit a support ticket. 

The following sections are available within the organization dashboard: 

<a name='Top'></a>

## Dashboard

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/organizations/dashboard/organization_dashboard.png"></div>

The dashboard tab has three sections; Authenticated Services, Email Digest, and API Key.

#### Authenticated Services

This is where you can authenticate third party services so your team members will not have to authenticate individual services.

***Note: backstitch never accesses information from your account; authorization just allows backstitch the authority to retrieve publicly available content on your behalf.***

#### Email Digest

The Email Digest section allows you to manage if and when your team members receive a digest of currated content updates. You can choose whether or not to send a digest at all, what days of the week to send it on, and at what time the digest gets sent out.

#### API Key

If you have access to our developer api this is where you can get the organization API key from.

***Note: The backstitch API is only available to our Business and Enterprise plans (more info on plans [here]()).***
