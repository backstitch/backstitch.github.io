Organizations are only available to backstitch for Business customers. For more information, *click* [here](http://backstit.ch/business).

Organizations are made up of teams. Business plan users can create unlimited teams as they see fit, while members of the Team plan are only allowed a single team for their organization (more info on plans [here]()).

### Organization Settings 

Once your organization is created, you can access your organization dashboard by *clicking* the **settings gear** in the upper right corner of backstitch and then *clicking* the name of your organization. 

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/settings_organization.png"></div>

The organization dashboard allows you to manage your organization, view analytics, submit a support ticket, create topics, etc. 

The following sections are available in the organization dashboard: 

<a name='Top'></a>
- [Dashboard](#Dashboard)
- [Team Members](#TeamMembers)
- [Topics](#Topics)
- [Theme](#Theme)
- [Billing](#Billing)
- [Support](#Support)

## Dashboard

The dashboard tab is where you can view and manage common organization information and settings. If you have any topics with the API or widget add-on enabled (more info [here]()), you can view how many calls are currently used and what topic is making those requests, using the two sections on the left (**Total API Calls**, and **API Requests**).

The right-hand column contains the **Authenticated Services** section, which allows your organization to authorize social media accounts for use in the organization's topic pages. Organizations use organization-wide service authentication so your team-members don't have to authenticate their individual accounts. 

Below **Authenticated Services** is your organization's **API Key**, which is used to make API and widget requests. 

The **Email Digest** section allows you to manage if and when your team-members receive a digest of currated content updates. You can choose whether or not to send a digest at all, what days of the week to send it on, and at what time the digest gets sent out.

## Team Members

The team members tab allows you to create, delete, and edit teams within your organization, as well as keep track of how active your team members are on backstitch. 

#### Add Team

*Clicking* the **+Add Team** button allows you to create a new team for your organization. Different teams can have different topic pages and admins, but are limited by your plan (more info on plans [here]()).

#### Add Team Members

There are a few methods for adding team members to your organization and their respective teams. 

- Users can be invited directly, by *clicking* on the **+Invite Member** button. By typing in an email address and *clicking* **invite**, that user will then be sent an invite email. By following the instructions in that email, that user will then be added to your team.

  <div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/invite_member.png"></div>

- Users that are already a part of the organization can be added to the currently selected team by *clicking* on the **+Add Member** button. You can then add individual members to this team by *clicking* the green **+** button to the left of their email or you can choose to add all of the members of your organizaton to this team by *clicking* the **Add all** button.

  <div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/add_member.png"></div>

- You can also set your company's email domain as an Allowed Domain. Anyone that signs up for backstitch with this particular email domain will automatically be sent an invite email to join your team. To do this, simply *click* the **Allowed Domains** button, *type* the desired domain into the text box, *click* **add**, and then *click* **Done**

## Topics

The topics tab allows you to create, edit, and delete your organization's topics. You can create topics for your entire organization or for specific teams within your organization. These topics are limited by your plan (more info on that [here]()).

You can create a new topic for a given team by *clicking* the **+Create Topic** button. You can also create a topic for a team by *clicking* the large **+** button located on the navigation bar, *clicking* **Create A New Topic** and then selecting your team from the dropdown.

There are a couple of different options for your topics when they are apart of a team. 

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/team_topic.png"></div>

- *Clicking* **YES** under **Auto follow** will automatically subscribe all new team members to this topic, adding it to their list of subscribed topics. 
- *Clicking* **YES** under **Allow unfollow** will allow your team members to unfollow the topic, thereby not seeing any of the results from the topic anymore. By choosing **NO**, team members will not be given the option to unfollow the topic.
- *Clicking* the **yellow star** in the upper-left corner will set this topic as the team's default topic. When team members log into backstitch they will be greeted with your default topic (note: only one default topic can be selected at a time). 
- *Clicking* the **X** in the upper right corner will give you the option to remove the topic from the team (but will still be accessible by you), or to delete the topic forever (this cannot be undone).

## Theme

The theme tab allows you to change your organization's name, logo, and color scheme (available only to Business plan subscribers, more info [here]()).

#### Name

Simply *click* the **choose logo** button, *locate* the appropriate image file on your computer, and then *click* **save**. This logo will replace the backstitch logo in the upper-left corner of backstitch for your team members and will also serve as the heading of your organization's digest emails. 

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/org_logo.png"></div>

#### Change Color

Business plan members can choose their color to re-brand backstitch with. Simply *click* one of the displayed colors or *type* a hex value into the text box and *click* **save**. This will change the top navigation bar to your organization's branding color, as well as other accents throughout backstitch.
