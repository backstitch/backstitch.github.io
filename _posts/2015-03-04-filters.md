Filters help your topic page weed out the content you don't care about and only focus on the things you do care about. Backstitch has three different types of filters: include filters, exclude filters, and a NSFW (not safe for work) filter. 

Both include filters and exclude filters can be set on both the topic (to filter all results) or on individual feeds within the topic (to only filter that feed). 

### Include Filters

Setting an include filter will ensure that only results containing that word or phrase will be returned. For example: setting an include filter of 'Detroit' on your topic will ensure that only results mentioning 'Detroit' are returned. 

These are 'or' filters, meaning that setting multiple filters will return any results mentioning any of the filters. So, adding another include filter of 'Ann Arbor' to your topic will return any results that include either 'Ann Arbor' or 'Detroit'.

### Exclude Filters

Exclude filters are the exact opposite of include filters. Setting an exclude filter will reject any results mentioning that word or phrase. For example: setting an exclude filter of 'Cleveland' on your topic page feed will reject all results from all feeds that mention 'Cleveland'. 

These filters, like include filters, are 'or' filters. This means that results mentioning any of the  exclude filters will be rejected. For example: adding another exclude filter of 'Chicago' to your topic page will reject all results mentioning either 'Cleveland' or 'Chicago'.

### NSFW Filter

Backstitch also offers a NSFW (not safe for work) filter that will attempt to filter out any pornographic or offensive content from your feed. To enable this filter, navigate to the topic editor and check the 'Hide obscure content' checkbox that is located underneat the exclude filters section.
