### Adding Sources

Adding sources is done from the discover sources screen, which is accessed by clicking the '+Add More' button in the 'Included Sources' section of the topic editor. You are also automatically greeted with this screen after creating a new topic.

Sources from a social media site (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Flickr, and Instagram) will require you to authenticate your account from that particular site with backstitch before you can see results or add results from that site to your backstitch topic page. Authenticating sources can be done from the account settings page (accessed from the gear in the top bar) or right from the discover sources screen.

### Removing Sources

Sources can be removed at any time. There are three different ways to do this. 

- From the topic editor, clicking the 'X' in the upper right corner of any source in the 'Included Sources' section will remove that source from your topic.

- Clicking on a source in the 'Included Sources' section of the topic editor will open the individual source editor. Clicking the red 'remove' button in the lower-right corner of this window will remove the source from the topic.

- Finally, on larger screens, sources can be removed from the discover sources window. In the 'included sources' section on the right of the window, every source will have a '- remove' option in the upper-right corner. Clicking this will remove that source.

### Filtering Sources

Like topic pages, individual sources can be filtered to receive the best results for what you care about. Filters put on individual sources will only apply to that source, not the entire topic. These filters can be applied from two different places.

You can get more information about filters by clicking [here]({% post_url 2015-03-04-filters %})

- On a larger screen (such as a desktop, laptop, or tablet) - from the discover sources screen in the 'included sources' section on the right. Clicking the filter icon will slide out filter options for that individual source.

- From the topic editor, clicking on a source in the 'included sources' section will open a source editor that will allow you to set include and exclude filters on that source.
