#FAQs

####How do I create a post?
To create a post, move your mouse to the "+" button on the bottom right corner. It should automatically become a "Create Post" button. Click on it to create a popup where you name the post, then click "create".

####How do I create a new Internal Source?
In Studio, Internal Sources are known as Categories. To create a new category for holding your posts, click on the "+" button on the bottom right side. When it automatically becomes "Create Post," hover up to the "New Category" button that automatically appears right above that.

####How do I go back?
You can access the initial page by clicking on your account settings on the top right corner, and then selecting "recent posts." Or, you can click on the Studio logo on the top left corner as well. 

####What's the difference between archive and delete?
When a post is published to backstitch, it can only be archived, as it has already been sent out. Unpublished posts are able to be deleted since they have not been sent out to anyone yet. However, when a post is archived, it is not deleted. To delete a published post, you must go to the Internal Sources tab of the team account inside backstitch, and delete the post there.

####Can I modify posts in backstitch?
Yes! Studio is fully integrated with backstitch, so you are able to edit posts that you have created in Studio with backstitch and vice versa. Posts that were already published into backstitch will be automatically updated when they are edited in Studio.

####How can I delete a Category?
As of now, you cannot delete Categories from Studio. However, because Studio is completely integrated with backstitch, you can go to your Internal Sources underneath your team account, and delete it from the "Internal Sources" tab on the left side.
