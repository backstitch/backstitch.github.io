####Need help categorizing and managing your posts?

You can use the post manager here to modify how you sort and group your posts. Simply choose which category you would like the post to be in, then create a post with the "+" icon on the bottom right.

If you want to add another category, just go to the "+" icon then click the purple "New Category" icon after.
