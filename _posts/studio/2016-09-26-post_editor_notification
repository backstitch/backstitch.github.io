####Hi, it looks like you're all ready to create your own posts.

The Post Editor is a more powerful word editor. You can type and format like any other word editor, insert images or videos, even create interactive buttons and polls.

The menu on the left contains various pieces of content you can insert into the post. The Clips tab contains backstitch topics. Assets hold a set of free stock images for you to use. Tools are specialty objects you can insert in, including custom buttons, polls, and a special automatic summarizer of you entire post.

When you are finished, just click the check mark on the bottom right side.
