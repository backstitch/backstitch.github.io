Organizations are only available to Backstitch for Business customers. For more information, click [here](http://backstit.ch/business).

Organizations are made up of teams. Backstitch for Business users that are apart of the Business plan can create unlimited teams as they see fit, while members of the Team plan are only allowed the first team which contains all members of the organization (more info on plans [here]({% post_url 2015-03-04-plans %})).

### Organization Settings 

Once your organization is created, you can access your organization dashboard by clicking the gear in the upper right corner of backstitch and then clicking the name of your organization. 

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/settings_organization.png"></div>

Clicking on your organization name will bring you to the organization dashboard. Here you can manage your organization, view analytics, submit a support ticket, create topics, etc. 

The sections available in the organization dashboard are: 

- [Dashboard](#Dashboard)
- [Team Members](#TeamMembers)
- [Topics](#Topics)
- [Custom Theme](#Theme)
- [Billing](#Billing)
- [Support](#Support)

## Dashboard

The dashboard tab is where you can view and manage common organization information and settings. If you have any topics with the API or widget add-on enabled (more info [here]({% post_url 2015-03-04-add-ons %})), you can view how many calls are currently used and what topic is making those requests using the two sections on the left (Total API Calls, and API Requests).

The right-hand column contains the Authenticated Services section, which allows your organization to authorize social media accounts for use in the organization's topic pages. Organizations use organization-wide service authentication so your team-members don't have to authenticate their individual accounts. 

Underneath that is your organization's API key, which is used to make API and widget requests. 

Finally, the Email Digest section allows you to manage if and when your team-members receive a digest of updates. You can choose whether or not to send a digest at all, what days of the week to send it on, and at what time the digest gets sent out.

## Team Members

The team members tab allows you to create, delete, and edit teams within your organization, as well as keep track of how active your team members are on backstitch. 

#### Add Team

Clicking the '+Add Team' button allows you to create a new team for your organization. Different teams can have different topic pages and admins, but are limited by your plan (more info on plans [here]({% post_url 2015-03-04-plans %})).

#### Add Team Members

There are two methods by which your team members can join your backstitch organization and their respective team. 

- Users can be invited directly by clicking on the +Invite Member button. By typing in an email and clicking 'invite', that person will be sent an invite email. By following the instructions in that email, that user will be added to your team.

  <div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/invite_member.png"></div>

- You can also set your company's email domain as an 'Allowed Domain'. Anyone that signs up for backstitch using this email will automatically be emailed a link to follow for them to join your team. 

  <div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/allowed_domains.png"></div>
  
Users that are already apart of the organization can be added to the currently selected team by clicking on the '+Add Member' button. 

<a name='Topics'></a>
## Topics

The topics tab allows you to create, edit, and delete your team topics. These topics are limited by your plan (more info on that [here]({% post_url 2015-03-04-plans %})).

You can create a new topic for your team here by clicking the "+Create Topic" button. You can also create a topic for your team by clicking the '+New Topic' button on the navigation bar, clicking "Create A New Topic" and then selecting your team from the dropdown.

There are a couple of different options for your topics when they are apart of a team. 

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/team_topic.png"></div>

- Clicking 'yes' under 'Auto subscribe' will automatically subscribe all new team members to this topic, adding it to their subscribed topics. 
- Clicking 'yes' under 'Allow unsubscribe' will allow your team members to unfollow the topic, thereby not seeing any of the results from the topic anymore. By choosing 'no', team members will not be given the option to unfollow the topic.
- Clicking the yellow star in the upper-left corner will set this topic as the team's default topic. Team members that log into backstitch and new team members alike will be greeted with your default topic (note: only one default topic can be selected at a time). 
- Clicking the 'X' in the upper right corner will give you the option to remove the topic from the team (but will still be accessible by you), or to delete the topic forever (this cannot be undone). 

## Theme

The theme tab allows you to change your organization's name and white-label backstitch with your team's color and logo (available only to Business plan subscribers, more info [here]({% post_url 2015-03-04-plans %})).

#### Name

You can change your organization's name at any time. Just type the new name into the text box and click 'save'. 

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/org_name.png"></div>

#### Change Logo

Business plan members can upload an image of their organization's logo here. Simply click the 'choose logo' button, locate the image file on your computer, and then click 'save'. This logo will replace the backstitch logo in the upper-left corner of backstitch for your team members and will also be in the heading of the organization's digest emails. 

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/org_logo.png"></div>

#### Change Color

Business plan members can choose their color to re-brand backstitch with. This will change the top navigation bar to your organization's branding color, as well as other accents throughout all of backstitch.

<a name='Billing'></a>
## Billing

The billing section is where you can change your backstitch for business plan, view your invoices, and view usage statistics for your organization's topic, user and API usage. You can also add and remove a payment method for your organization's backstitch for business plan, here.

<a name='Support'></a>
## Support

This tab allows you to find links to our API and widget documentation, as well as links back to this help document for future reference. Organization administrators can also submit support tickets on this tab, if they have any comments, questions, or concerns regarding anything with backstitch, their organization, or anything else.
