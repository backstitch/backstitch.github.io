## Discovering Sources

Discover sources helps you search for news sites, blogs, and even content from various social services (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Flickr, Instagram, Reddit, and more).

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/discover_sources_0.png"></div>

####The sort of searches you can perform:
- The exact name of a news site or blog
- Specific people or companies on social media
- Phrases mentioned on social media
- Video channels and photo groups
- Sites that talk about specified subjects
- Hashtags

To include a discovered source in your topic click the green **+ add** link.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/discover_sources_1.png"></div>

Many of the social services require activation with an account on their network to allow content inclusion into backstitch topic pages.  

To activate simply click the purple **Activate** button under each service and allow backstitch access from the window that opens.

## Copying Sources

Sometimes you will want to include all the sources already added to another topic.  With the "Copy Sources" tab it is easy to add all of the sources from another topic with one click.  

You will also find a list of helpful public topics that contain the top sources on subjects such as World News, Manufacturing, and Technology.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/copy_sources_0.png"></div>

***Tip: Create topics that contain the sources for things like key industry journals or your competitor's social streams and use these as "Master Source lists" for copying and filtering for specific topics.***
