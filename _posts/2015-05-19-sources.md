## Discovering Sources

Discover sources helps you search for news sites, blogs, and even content from various social services (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Flickr, Instagram, Reddit, and more).

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/discover_sources_0.png"></div>

####The sort of searches you can perform:
- The exact name of a news site or blog
- Specific people or companies on social media
- Phrases mentioned on social media
- Video channels and photo groups
- Sites that talk about specified subjects
- Hashtags

To include a discovered source in your topic click the green **+ add** link.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/discover_sources_1.png"></div>

Many of the social services require activation with an account on their network to allow content inclusion into backstitch topic pages.  

To activate simply click the purple **Activate** button under each service and allow backstitch access from the window that opens.
