## Discovering Sources

Discover sources helps you to find sources to include by searching for news sites, blogs, and even content from various social services (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Flickr, Instagram, Reddit, and more).

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/sources/discover_sources_0.png"></div>

####The sort of searches you can perform:
- The exact name of a news site or blog
- Specific people or companies on social media
- Phrases mentioned on social media
- Video channels and photo groups
- Sites that talk about specified subjects
- Hashtags

To include a discovered source into your topic click the green **+ add** link.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/sources/discover_sources_1.png"></div>

Many of the social services require activation with an account on their network to allow content inclusion into a backstitch topic.  

To activate simply click the purple **Activate** button under each service and allow backstitch access from the window that opens.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/sources/authenticate_discover.png"></div>

***Note: backstitch never accesses information from your account; authorization just allows backstitch the authority to retrieve publicly available content on your behalf.***

## Copying Sources

Sometimes you will want to include all the sources already added to another topic.  From the **Copy Sources** tab it is easy to add all of the sources included in another topic with one click.  

You will also find a list of helpful public topics that contain the top sources on subjects such as World News, Manufacturing, and Technology.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/sources/copy_sources_0.png"></div>

***Tip: Create topics that contain the sources for things like key industry journals or your competitor's social streams and use these as "Master Source lists" for copying and filtering into specific topics.***

From the **Crawl Sources** tab you can also install the **backstitch bookmarklet** that will allow you to crawl sources listed on any website right from your web browser.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/sources/filter_sources_0.png"></div>

## Importing an OPML file

If you have sources from another tool (such as an RSS reader or dashboard tool) you may be able to export your sources into an OPML file.  This can be imported directly into a topic from the **[Discover Sources](#DiscoverSources)** tab using the **Upload OPML** utility.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/sources/opml_sources.png"></div>

***It may take several minutes before all of your sources are copied over and appear included in your topic***
