A topic page is a collection of content that is focused around an idea.

Topics pages can include content from many sources such as News, Blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Tumblr, and more. This content can be focused around one idea by using filters to only show results that match particular phrases, or to exclude results that match particular phrases. 

Topic pages can be edited at any time (as long as you created it). So your topic pages can always be evolving and changing to be updated with new sources or filters as you see fit. 

## Creating a topic page
  
Creating a topic page is simple! On your navigation bar at the top of the screen, you will see a "+ New Topic" button. Click this and from the dropdown, click on "Create a new topic". 

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/create_new_topic.png"></div>

In the following dialog, just give your topic a name and click next. By clicking next, you will be brought to the discover sources section. Here, you can search for anything you want to add to your topic page, including Facebook pages, Instagram profiles, Twitter accounts, RSS feeds, etc. Filters can also be added from this screen, to make the content in your topic even more relevant and specific.

## Editing a topic page

Your topic page, once created, can be edited at any time. To do this, simply navigate to your topic page and click the 'edit' button located on the right of the toolbar. 

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/edit_button.png"></div>

Clicking this button will bring you to the topic editor screen. Here, you can edit the topic's filters, sources, name, banner, and add-ons (if available).
