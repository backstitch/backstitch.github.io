A topic page is a collection of content that is focused around an idea.

Topics pages can include content from many sources such as News, Blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Tumblr, and more. This content can be focused around one idea by using filters to only show results that match particular phrases, or to exclude results that match particular phrases. 

Topic pages can be edited at any time (as long as you created it). So your topic pages can always be evolving and changing to be updated with new sources or filters as you see fit. 

## Creating a topic page
  
Creating a topic page is simple! On your navigation bar at the top of the screen, you will see a "+ New Topic" button. Click this and from the dropdown, click on "Create a new topic". 

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/create_new_topic.png"></div>

In the following dialog, just give your topic a name and click next. By clicking next, you will be brought to the discover sources section. Here, you can search for anything you want to add to your topic page, including Facebook pages, Instagram profiles, Twitter accounts, RSS feeds, etc. Filters can also be added from this screen, to make the content in your topic even more relevant and specific.

## Editing a topic page

Your topic page, once created, can be edited at any time. To do this, simply navigate to your topic page and click the 'edit' button located on the right of the toolbar. 

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/edit_button.png"></div>

Clicking this button will bring you to the topic editor screen. Here, you can edit the topic's filters, sources, name, banner, and add-ons (if available). 

 
## Viewing a topic page

Your topic pages consist of the results region, the cover region, and the toolbar region. 

#### Cover Region

The cover region will display either an uploaded banner (if there is one), or a mosaic of pictures that is automatically assembled from the results in your topic page. This cover region can be disabled in the topic editor by checking the "Hide Banner" box. 

#### Toolbar

Below the cover is the topic page toolbar. Here you can search for results in the topic page by entering a search phrase into the box, and depending on the topic page, there will be a few different options here.

- Edit - If this is your topic, or you're an administrator of the organization that owns this topic, you can click this button to be brought to the topic editor.
- Share - Click this button to share this topic page to Facebook or Twitter. 
- Presentation mode - If this is an organization topic with the presentation mode add-on activated, clicking this button will enter presentation mode for the topic. 
- Follow - If this topic doesn't belong to you and you aren't following it already, this option will allow you to add it to your topics.
- Unfollow - If this isn't your topic and the organization allows for you to unfollow a topic, clicking this will remove it from your topics. 

#### Results Region

Finally, the main region of every topic page, is the results region. This is where all of your results from your selected feeds, after being filtered, are shown. Clicking on a result will either open a new tab and bring you to source (if you have Open results in backstitch turned off, or the article hasn't been indexed yet), or will open the result in the backstitch viewer.
