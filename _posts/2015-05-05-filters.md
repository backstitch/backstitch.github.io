Filters help you focus your topic page to only the things you do care about. 

Backstitch has two types of filters: basic and advanced.

## Basic Filters

Basic filters are made up of include filters and exclude filters:

### Include Filters

Setting an **include** filter will ensure that results mentioning at least one of the words or phrases entered will be returned.

Example: If you add the filters of **Detroit** and **Ann Arbor** to your topic any results that mentions either **Detroit** or **Ann Arbor** will be returned.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/include_filter.png"></div>
 
### Exclude Filters

Setting an **exclude** filter will reject any results mentioning at least one of word or phrase entered.

Example: If you add the filters of **Cleveland** and **Chicago** your topic will reject any results that mentions either **Cleveland** or **Chicago**.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/exclude_filter.png"></div>

## Advanced Filters

Basic filters made up of groups of any filters, all filters, and none filters:

### Any Filters

Setting an **any** filter will ensure that results mentioning at least one of the words or phrases entered will be returned.

Adding filters of **Detroit** and **Ann Arbor** to your topic will return any results that mentions either **Detroit** or **Ann Arbor**.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/any_filter.png"></div>

### All Filters

Setting an **all** filter will ensure that results mentioning all of the words or phrases entered will be returned.

Adding filters of **Urban** and **Farming** to your topic will return any results that mentions both **Urban** and **Farming**.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/all_filter.png"></div>

### Any/All Operation

This setting can be set to **and** or **or**:

#### and

Setting this to **and** in our example will give the results that mention **Detroit** and **Urban** and **Farming** *or* **Ann Arbor** and **Urban** and **Farming**.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/any_and_all_filter.png"></div>

#### or

Setting this to **or** in our example will give the results that mention **Detroit** or **Ann Arbor** or **Urban** and **Farming**.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/any_or_all_filter.png"></div>
 
### None Filters

Setting a **none** filter will reject any results mentioning at least one of word or phrase entered.

Adding filters of **Cleveland** and **Chicago** to your topic will reject any results that mentions either **Cleveland** or **Chicago**.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/none_filter.png"></div>

### Adding Another Group

Filter groups can be chained together with **and** and **or** for more complex filtering:

## Hide Obscure Content Filter

Backstitch offers a **Hide obscure content** filter that will attempt to filter out any pornographic or offensive content from your topic. 

To enable this filter, navigate to the topic editor and check the **Hide obscure content** box that is located at the bottom of the topic filters.
