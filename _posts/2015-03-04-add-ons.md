Add-ons are only available to Backstitch for Business customers. For more information, click [here](http://backstit.ch/business).

Backstitch offers 5 different topic add-ons (as of now) to get you and your users the most out of your backstitch topic pages. These add-ons are added to individual topics by navigating to the topic, clicking the 'edit topic' button on the right of the toolbar, and scrolling to the bottom of the editor to the 'Add-Ons' section. Different plans offer different access to add-ons (more info [here]({% post_url 2015-03-04-plans %})).

Clicking the 'Explore' button will open a window with all of your available add-ons. The 5 different add-ons are:

<a name='API'></a>
#### API

*Available to team and business subscribers*

Activating this add-on will turn on API access to the topic page. This allows you, using the API key provided, to make calls within your app to endpoints described in the [API documentation](http://docs.backstit.ch/api) to use results provided in this topic page in any way you want. By clicking this add-on, you can check the total amount of calls this topic has used, remove the add-on, retrieve this topic's API token, and find a link to the API documentation.

<a name='PresentationMode'></a>
#### Presentation Mode

*Available to business subscribers only*

This allows your topic page to be displayed in an automatically-updating, cascading view that is perfect for social media walls, office displays, events, etc. All images will be displaying a grid-style view with the full image visible, the navigation bar, banner and toolbar will all be removed, and the topic will automatically display new results without the need to refresh. 

Clicking the add-on will give you the option to remove it from the topic, a short description of the add-on, and the option to require result approvals before they are displayed on the topic. This option will require an administrator to manually approve posts before they appear on the screen, giving you a level of control over what is displayed on the screen.

Once this add-on is activated on a topic, entering presentation mode is as simple as navigating to the topic and clicking the 'expand' button in the toolbar.

Exiting presentation mode is as simple as clicking the 'collapse' icon in the upper-right of the screen. Mousing over the upper-right corner of the screen will make this icon much easier to see.

<a name='Widget'></a>
#### Widget

*Available to team and business subscribers*

The backstitch widget allows you to embed your topic page content on your blog, company website, or anywhere else on the web where HTML is embeddable. It is a very simple, lightweight bit of code that can just be copied and pasted anywhere, without any further customization necessary. 

Clicking on the add-on will open a window that shows you how many widget calls this topic has made, an option to remove the add-on from the topic, a box containing the embed code, and an option to choose how many results are displayed within the widget. 

For more information about the backstitch widget, visit our [API & Widget documentation by clicking here](http://docs.backstit.ch/api).

<a name='Wordpress'></a>
#### Share to Wordpress

*Available to business subscribers only*

The Share to Wordpress add-on allows you to do all of your content marketing and blogging on Wordpress right from within backstitch. By enabling this add-on and authorizing your backstitch account with your Wordpress blog, you can easily start a blog post based on interesting results you've found on backstitch to all of your users without ever having to leave your topic page. 

Activating and clicking on this add-on will bring you to the Share to Wordpress window, which gives you the option to authorize your blog with backstitch and to remove the add-on from the topic. 

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/share_to_wordpress_add_on.png"></div>

Once activated, starting a blog post from within backstitch is simple. Just click on a result that you want to share and then click on the Wordpress logo on the action bar on the right.
