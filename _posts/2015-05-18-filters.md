Filters help to craft your topic to be even more relevant and specific to your interests.  When adding filters to backstitch there are two options:

<a name='Top'></a>
<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/basic_advanced_filters.png"></div>
1. **[Basic Filters](#BasicFilters)**<br />
2. **[Advanced Filters](#AdvancedFilters)**<br />

and they can each be added as either **[Topic Filters](#TopicFilters)** or **[Source Filters](#SourceFilters)**.

## Basic Filters

Basic filters let you specify keywords or phrases that should be included *and not* included in the content of your **[topic]({% post_url 2015-05-19-topics %})**.

Basic filters are made up of <font color="#208b1b">**include filters**</font> and <font color="#9f101b">**exclude filters**</font>:

### <font color="#208b1b">Include Filters</font>

Setting an include filter will ensure that your topic will only show content from your **[sources]({% post_url 2015-05-19-sources %})** that contains _**at least one**_ of the words or phrases specified.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/basic_filters_0.png"></div>

***Example: If you want content that mentions either <u>Toronto</u> or <u>Calgary</u>.***
 
### <font color="#9f101b">Exclude Filters</font>

Setting an exclude filter will ensure that your topic will not show any content from your **[sources]({% post_url 2015-05-19-sources %})** that contains _**any**_ of the words or phrases specified.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/basic_filters_1.png"></div>

***Example: If you don't want any content that mentions <u>tourism</u>, <u>travel</u> or <u>sightseeing</u>.***

## Advanced Filters

Advanced filters lets you chain together groups of keywords or phrases where <font color="#208b1b">**any**</font>, <font color="#00688b">**all**</font> and <font color="#9f101b">**none**</font> of those specified should be mentioned in your topic's content.

### <font color="#208b1b">Any Filters</font>

Setting an any filter will ensure that your topic will show content from your **[sources]({% post_url 2015-05-19-sources %})** that contains _**at least one**_ of the words or phrases specified.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/advanced_filters_0.png"></div>

***Example: If you want content that mentions either <u>urban farming</u> or <u>urban chicken coop</u>.***

### <font color="#00688b">All Filters</font>

Setting an all filter will ensure that your topic will only show content from your **[sources]({% post_url 2015-05-19-sources %})** that contains _**every**_ word or phrase specified.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/advanced_filters_1.png"></div>

***Example: If you want content that mentions both <u>Detroit</u> and <u>ordinances</u>.***

### <font color="#9f101b">None Filters</font>

Setting a none filter will ensure that your topic will not show any content from your **[sources]({% post_url 2015-05-19-sources %})** that contains _**any**_ of the words or phrases specified.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/advanced_filters_2.png"></div>

***Example: If you don't want any content that mentions <u>tree farms</u>.***

### AND/OR Operator

The operation that evaluates the list of <font color="#208b1b">**any filters**</font> with the <font color="#00688b">**all filters**</font> can be toggled from the default **and operator** to be instead evaluated as an **or operator**. 

 _To toggle simply click the operator between the any and all filter tabs._

#### AND Operator

If you wanted content that mentioned <font color="#208b1b">urban farming</font> **or** <font color="#208b1b">urban chicken coop</font> <u>**AND**</u> <font color="#00688b">Detroit</font> **and** <font color="#00688b">ordinances</font>.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/advanced_filters_3.png"></div>
<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/advanced_filters_4.png"></div>

#### OR Operator

If you wanted content that mentioned <font color="#208b1b">urban farming</font> **or** <font color="#208b1b">urban chicken coop</font> <u>**OR**</u> <font color="#00688b">Detroit</font> **and** <font color="#00688b">ordinances</font>.

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/advanced_filters_5.png"></div>
<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/advanced_filters_6.png"></div>
 
### Adding Another Filter Group

Multiple filter groups can be chained together to build more complex filters.  

To add another group click on the purple **+ Add filter group** button underneath an existing filter group and select the operator **(AND/OR)** to determine how the two groups should be evaluated together.

## Topic Filters

Topic filters act as a global filter across all of your topic's sources collectively.  

From the <a href="/2015/05/19/topics/#EditingTopics" target="_blank"><b>topic edit screen</b></a> topic filters are managed on the right side of the screen:

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/topic_filters_0.png"></div>

From the <a href="/2015/05/19/sources/#DiscoverSources" target="_blank"><b>add sources dialog</b></a> topic filters can be found by expanding the drawer underneath **Filter All Sources**:

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/topic_filters_1.png"></div>

***Advanced filters aren't manageable from the filter drawer***

<a name='SourceFilters'></a>

## Source Filters

Source filters allow for setting filters only on a specific source.  This is great for building topics that contain both very on subject sources alongside generic content sources with filters.

From the <a href="/2015/05/19/topics/#EditingTopics" target="_blank"><b>topic edit screen</b></a> ***click*** on an included source to manage its filters:

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/source_filters_0.png"></div>

From the <a href="/2015/05/19/sources/#DiscoverSources" target="_blank"><b>add sources dialog</b></a> a source's filters can be found by expanding the drawer underneath its name in the right-hand column:

<div class="full zoomable"><img src="/images/source_filters_1.png"></div>

***Advanced filters aren't manageable from the filter drawer***

Once you are finished typing your filter simply ***press*** **Enter** on your keyboard to save your filter.  It should turn a solid color to let you know it has saved properly.

###Q: Do I need to add both the plural and singular form of my filters?
backstitch takes word variation such as plural forms into account so there is no need to add both the singular and plural form.

###Q: Do I need to put quotes around a phrase?
Filters that consist of multiple words are automatically quoted and match as an exact phrase.

###Q: How long does it take for my filter to start taking effect?
As with any changes to a topic (such as adding or removing sources) it may take a few moments to re-index your content.  Try refreshing your topic after 10-30 seconds to see the changes have taken effect.

###Q: How do I know why is this content is in my topic?
backstitch will attempt to highlight sentences that match the filters set.

###Q: What parts of the content can I filter by?
Every part of the content including the body, title, author name, and even social media usernames are filterable.
